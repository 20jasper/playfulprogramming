If you want to learn more about our sponsorships and how they impact our site, you can read through [our disclosures that we've posted on GitHub](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adisclosure+is%3Aclosed).

TLDR: No sponsor has any say about the content hosted on the site

# Statement of Ethics {#ethics}

We never want to end up in a place where our educational content, experience, or community is compromised by either financial sway or potentially harmful members of the community. As such, we've implemented the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as our [code of conduct](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to uphold these values.

We also pledge to maintain transparency in regards to any finances that flow through the project. Not every sponsorship contains a financial contribution, but if one does we will disclose both what those finances are going towards and what will be done in exchange.
