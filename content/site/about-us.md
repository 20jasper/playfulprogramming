> Our goal is to provide the best resources possible to learn any computer science related topic

Whether it's from how memory is allocated in assembly or how to do complex CSS animations, to what a For loop is, we want to provide resources that are welcoming, supportive, and informational.

Our content will have a wide range of subject matters, difficulty curves, and (we hope) perspectives. We want to make resources for the seasoned full-time developer just as we would a newcomer hobbyist and everyone between the two.

 We know this is a lofty goal, though, and we don't want to do it alone. If you're interested in helping out, open a pull request and help us reach others by providing translations, help the code maintenance on this site, write a post for us, or jump in on discussions and help other readers.
 
 If youâ€™d like to get in touch with us, our GitHub is probably the best way to do so.
