> Our goal is to provide the best resources possible to learn any computer science related topic

Whether it's from how memory is allocated in assembly or how to do complex CSS animations, to what a For loop is, we want to provide resources that are welcoming, supportive, and informational.

Our content will have a wide range of subject matters, difficulty curves, and (we hope) perspectives. We want to make resources for the seasoned full-time developer just as we would a newcomer hobbyist and everyone between the two.

We know this is a lofty goal, though, and we don't want to do it alone. If you're interested in helping out, [open a pull request](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/pulls) and help us reach others by providing translations, [help the code maintenance on this site](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [write a post for us](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances#blog-posts), or [jump in on discussions and help other readers on our Discord](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T).
 
If youâ€™d like to get in touch with us, [our Discord](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T) is probably the best way to do so.

## Statement of Ethics {#ethics}

We never want to end up in a place where our educational content or the community or
experience around that content is compromised. Not by money and not by any potential
of harmful members within said community. As a result,
[we've implemented the Contributor Covenant as our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We also pledge to keep transparent communication in regards to finances
that flow through the project. While not every sponsorship contains a
financial contribution, if one does it will be disclosed both what those
finances are going towards as well as what will be done in exchange for
said contribution will be clearly and transparently laid out.
