<p><span class="text-style-headline-2">Our goal is to provide the best resources possible to learn any computer science related topic</span></p>

Whatâ€™s a for loop? How do I create animations in CSS? How is memory allocated in Assembly? No matter what the topic is, we want our website to be welcoming, supportive and informational.

Our content will have a wide range of subject matters, difficulty curves, and (we hope) perspectives. We want to make resources for the seasoned full-time developer just as we would a newcomer hobbyist and everyone between the two.

We know this is a lofty goal, though, and we don't want to do it alone. If you're interested in helping out, [open a pull request](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/pulls) and help us reach others by providing translations, [help the code maintenance on this site](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [write a post for us](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances#blog-posts), or [jump in on discussions and help other readers on our Discord](https://discord.gg/FMcvc6T).

# Where to find us, you ask?

We have various social media accounts where we share updates and new content with folks! We also have a YouTube channel where we host livestreams, recorded talks, and much more educational content on computer science related topics.

As mentioned previously, we also have a Discord where we chat tech, help out with CS related problems and questions, and generally have a good time. If you're looking to get in touch with us, this is probably the best way to do so.

# Statement of Ethics \{#ethics\}

We never want to end up in a place where our educational content, experience, or community is compromised by either financial sway or potentially harmful members of the community. As such, we've implemented the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as our [code of conduct](https://github.com/unicorn-utterances/unicorn-utterances/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to uphold these values.

We also pledge to maintain transparency in regards to any finances that flow through the project. Not every sponsorship contains a financial contribution, but if one does we will disclose both what those finances are going towards and what will be done in exchange.
