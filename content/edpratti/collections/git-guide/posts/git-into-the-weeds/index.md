**If you haven't already, please catch up on our previous post!**

We will only summarize when needed for clarification. If you're not familiar with the basics of Git, this article is not for you!

We'll start with one simple operation we haven't seen before: Cherry-picking.

# Cherry-picking

As the name implies, cherry-picking allows you to select a specific commit from a branch and apply it to another.

This is useful if you need a certain change or fix to be applied right away, without having to merge incomplete commits or in-progress feature pushes.
