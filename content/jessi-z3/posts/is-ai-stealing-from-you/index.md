# Is AI Stealing fromÂ You?

![](./1*qVOXOZ07u5b1ESvM4yfxyg.jpg)

Have you ever seen Silicon Valley? On the show, a gentleman develops an app that determines whether a picture is a hot dog or not. This is an example of machine learning. Stay with me here.

Machine learning means that if you give a machine data, it can learn that data to be able to recall a specified result. This is like human learning. If I give you data, you can recall it.

Sometimes we don't have data at our fingertips, so we go online to look for information. There is nothing stopping me from copying online data into my own projects, but it's a lot more ethical if I cite my sources.

AI does this too. It can compile from searches and cite its sources. Just like before, we still have to decipher those sources as legitimate or trustworthy, but once it's on the internet, there's no stopping someone from grabbing that data. There's no stopping the machine either.

There should be some sort of protection in place if you don't want your material used. Sure, but there isn't. Handling infringements is all done through legal channels (not software). If your data is freely accessible, a computer cannot steal it from you. You gave it willingly.

If you make something, it's on you to go through legal channels to protect what you made. If you make a painting, take a picture, share it on a freely accessible website, I can make my own version. If I use the exact photo without your permission, it's on you to initiate legal action. If your painting is hanging in a gallery, I can take my own photo of the painting.

There's a lot of nuance here. That's why there are laws that are studied by people for years who become experts in this field that are consulted in these matters.
