# Flexbox

The CSS property `display: flex` is also known as flexbox. Adding `display: flex` to a container will cause any immediate descendants to become flex items.

Flexbox is used for creating one-dimensional layouts on a column (up and down) or row (left and right) direction. To change said direction, we must change the following property:

# Using `flex-direction`

```css
flex-direction: column;
```

![A column of three items stacked on one-another](./flex-column.svg)

```css
flex-direction: row;
```

![A row of three items stacked next to one-another](./flex-row.svg)

# Using `flex-wrap`

This property allows you to make dynamic layouts that can respond to dimension constraints. In practice, it means you can tell a `flex` layout to wrap into a new rowUr columnUf there is not enough space available. Let's look at a simple example:

```css
.flex-container {
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

![Two examples of elements in a row. The second example has a smaller width, thus causing the layout to wrap into a new line](./flex-wrap.svg)

# Using `flex-flow`

The `flex-flow` property allows us to use just one command to define both the `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties!

If we wanted to set up the previous example using this property, we'd do so like this:

```css
.flex-container {
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}
```

# Using `align-items`

This property allows you to arrange your items between the `start`, `center` or `end` of a given layout.

For the following example, the `flex-direction` has been set to row. This will become important later.

```css
align-items: center;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the middle of the container](./flex-align-items-center.svg)

```css
align-items: flex-end;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the bottom of the container](./flex-align-items-end.svg)

```css
align-items: flex-start;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the top of the container](./flex-align-items-start.svg)

> #### Important! The `start` and `end` suffixes are axis-dependent.
>
> When a flex layout is set to `row`, the start and end will point to top and bottom.
>
> When a flex layout is set to `column`, the start and end will point to left and right.


# Using `justify-content`

This property is used to distribute your content across the main axis of a flex layout. 

This can serve as an alignment property, or as a way to space out your content. Here are the available values.

## Start, center & end

These control the alignment from left, to center, to right. Keep in mind that the values `start` and `end` can change depending on RTL layouts.

```css
justify-content: center;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the center of the container](./flex-justify-center.svg)


```css
justify-content: flex-end;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the end of the container](./flex-justify-end.svg)

```css
justify-content: flex-start;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the start of the container](./flex-justify-start.svg)

## Space elements

You can also space elements using three commands: `space-around`, `space-between` and `space-evenly`.


```css
/* Each item has equal emount of space around itself,
meaning gap between items are twice the spacing value. */
justify-content: space-around;
```

![Three items in a container with one item in the center and the other two on the left and right with spacing equal the left and right](./flex-justify-space-around.svg)

```css
/* Space items so that they fill
the entire size of the container. */
justify-content: space-between;
```

![Three items in a container with one item in the center and the other two on the furthest left and right](./flex-justify-space-between.svg)

```css
/* Make it so the space between the edges and
the gaps between elements are equal. */
justify-content: space-evenly;
```

![Three items in a container with equal spacing on all sides](./flex-justify-space-evenly.svg)

# `Grow`, `shrink` and `basis`

<--TODO-->

## Using `flex-grow`

Initial.

![Alt description](./flex-grow-initial.svg)

Distribute.

```css
.box {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

![Alt description](./flex-grow-three-columns.svg)

All good. Now let's change the label.

![Alt description](./flex-grow-new-label.svg)

#### Why did this happen?

In our first example:

![Alt description](./flex-grow-bts.svg)

This is because the `flex-grow` property *distributes the space* that's available around the elements.

![Alt description](./flex-grow-space-available.svg)

This means that, if the starting size of an element is bigger than another, they will continue to be larger when `flex-grow: 1` is set!

![Alt description](./flex-grow-space-distributed.svg)

#### How do we solve this?

For that, we need to move onto the next property, which helps us set the initial size of an element.

## Using `flex-basis`

# When to use flexbox?

- Used in headers, lists, tags, or any other block or inline content with the appropriate `flex-direction`;
- Primary method to align and justify content in small components;
