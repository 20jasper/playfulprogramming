In this chapter we will talk everything layout related, and start getting into the weeds of responsive design. Starting with Flexbox.

# Flexbox

The CSS property `display: flex` is also known as flexbox. Adding `display: flex` to a container will cause any immediate descendants to become flex items.

Flexbox is used for creating one-dimensional layouts on a column (up and down) or row (left and right) direction. To change said direction, we must change the following property:

# Using `flex-direction`

```css
flex-direction: column;
```

![A column of three items stacked on one-another](./flex-column.svg)

```css
flex-direction: row;
```

![A row of three items stacked next to one-another](./flex-row.svg)

# Using `flex-wrap`

This property allows you to make dynamic layouts that can respond to dimension constraints. In practice, it means you can tell a `flex` layout to wrap into a new rowUr columnUf there is not enough space available. Let's look at a simple example:

![Two examples of elements in a row. The second example has a smaller width, thus causing the layout to wrap into a new line](./flex-wrap.svg)

# Using `align-items`

This property allows you to arrange your items between the `start`, `center` or `end` of a given layout.

For the following example, the `flex-direction` has been set to row. This will become important later.

```css
align-items: center;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the middle of the container](./flex-align-items-center.svg)

```css
align-items: flex-end;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the bottom of the container](./flex-align-items-end.svg)

```css
align-items: flex-start;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the top of the container](./flex-align-items-start.svg)

> #### Important! The `start` and `end` suffixes are axis-dependent.
>
> When a flex layout is set to `row`, the start and end will point to top and bottom.
>
> When a flex layout is set to `column`, the start and end will point to left and right.


# Using `justify-content`

This property is used to distribute your content across the main axis of a flex layout. 

This can serve as an alignment property, or as a way to space out your content. Here are the available values.

## Start, center & end

These control the alignment from left, to center, to right. Keep in mind that the values `start` and `end` can change depending on RTL layouts.

```css
justify-content: center;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the center of the container](./flex-justify-center.svg)


```css
justify-content: flex-end;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the end of the container](./flex-justify-end.svg)

```css
justify-content: flex-start;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the start of the container](./flex-justify-start.svg)

## Space elements

You can also space elements using three commands: `space-around`, `space-between` and `space-evenly`.


```css
/* Each item has equal emount of space around itself,
meaning gap between items are twice the spacing value. */
justify-content: space-around;
```

![Three items in a container with one item in the center and the other two on the left and right with spacing equal the left and right](./flex-justify-space-around.svg)

```css
/* Space items so that they fill
the entire size of the container. */
justify-content: space-between;
```

![Three items in a container with one item in the center and the other two on the furthest left and right](./flex-justify-space-between.svg)

```css
/* Make it so the space between the edges and
the gaps between elements are equal. */
justify-content: space-evenly;
```

![Three items in a container with equal spacing on all sides](./flex-justify-space-evenly.svg)

Here is a list of CSS properties used to control flexbox properties: 

> [`flex-grow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow): Controls a `flex` items grow factor

> [`flex-shrink`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink): Controls a `flex` items shrink factor

> [`flex-basis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis): Controls the initial size of a `flex` item

# When to use flexbox?

- Used in headers, lists, tags, or any other block or inline content with the appropriate `flex-direction`;
- Primary method to align and justify content in small components;

For example, YouTube uses a flexbox to space out their headers children elements:

![A heading on the YouTube search bar with spacing for each item](./youtube.png)

# Now what?

Now that we've learned a little bit of HTML, CSS, and looked over the main mechanics used to create beautiful and functional layouts, it's time to add interactivity to our prototypes! In the next chapter, we'll learn about native interactivity triggers, and how to add your own using JavaScript!

> **Coming soon:**
> The JavaScript chapter is currently in progress. It won't take long, but it's not ready just yet. Come back soon!
