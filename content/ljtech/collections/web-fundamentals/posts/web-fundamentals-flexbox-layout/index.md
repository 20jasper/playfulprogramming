### Welcome to the third installment of Web Fundamentals!

> **What you should know:**
> This chapter expects you to have read the previous two installments of Web Fundamentals.

In this chapter we will talk everything layout related, and start getting into the weeds of responsive design. Starting with Flexbox.

# Flexbox

The CSS property `display: flex` is also known as flexbox. Adding `display: flex` to a container will cause any immediate descendants to become flex items.

Flexbox is used for creating one-dimensional layouts on a column (up and down) or row (left and right) direction. To change said direction, we must change the following property:

## Using `flex-direction`

```css
flex-direction: column;
```

![A column of three items stacked on one-another](./flex-column.svg)

```css
flex-direction: row;
```

![A row of three items stacked next to one-another](./flex-row.svg)

## Using `flex-wrap`

This property allows you to make dynamic layouts that can respond to dimension constraints. In practice, it means you can tell a `flex` layout to wrap into a new row: Cr column: Cf there is not enough space available. Let's look at a simple example:

![Two examples of elements in a row. The second example has a smaller width, thus causing the layout to wrap into a new line](./flex-wrap.svg)

## Using `align-items`

This property allows you to arrange your items between the `start`, `center` or `end` of a given layout.

For the following example, the `flex-direction` has been set to row. This will become important later.

```css
align-items: center;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the middle of the container](./align-center.svg)

```css
align-items: flex-end;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the bottom of the container](./align-end.svg)

```css
align-items: flex-start;
```

![Three items in a container vertically aligned to the top of the container](./align-start.svg)

> #### Important! The `start` and `end` suffixes are axis-dependent.
>: Chen a flex layout is set to `row`, the start and end will point to top and bottom.
>: Chen a flex layout is set to `column`, the start and end will point to left and right.


## Using `justify-content`

This property is used to distribute your content across the main axis of a flex layout. 

This can serve as an alignment property, or as a way to space out your content. Here are the available values.

```css
justify-content: center;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the center of the container](./justify-center.svg)

```css
justify-content: flex-end;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the end of the container](./justify-end.svg)

```css
justify-content: flex-start;
```

![Three items in a container horizontally aligned to the start of the container](./justify-start.svg)

```css
justify-content: space-around;
```

![Three items in a container with one item in the center and the other two on the left and right with spacing equal the left and right](./justify-around.svg)

```css
justify-content: space-between;
```

![Three items in a container with one item in the center and the other two on the furthest left and right](./justify-between.svg)

```css
justify-content: space-evenly;
```

![Three items in a container with equal spacing on all sides](./justify-evenly.svg)

Here is a list of CSS properties used to control flexbox properties: 

> [`flex-grow ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow): Controls a `flex` items grow factor

> [`flex-shrink ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink): Controls a `flex` items shrink factor

> [`flex-basis ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis): Controls the initial size of a `flex` item

> âš¡ [Live Code Example: Flexbox Layout](https://codesandbox.io/s/flexbox-layout-p4cy8?file=/styles.css)

## Using `place`

Using a few additional CSS properties we can align, justify, and space these same flex items inside the container.

**These placement methods are used to distribute both flex and gridbox items.**

> [`place-content ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-content): Shorthand property for [`align-content ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content) and [`justify-content ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content)

> [`place-items ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-items): Shorthand property for [`align-items ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items) and [`justify-items ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-items)

> [`place-self ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-self): Shorthand property for [`align-self ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self) and [`justify-self ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-self)

> ðŸ¤“ These are some godly CSS properties that everyone should know about!

# Gridbox

The CSS property `display: grid` is commonly referred to as gridbox. Unlike flexbox, it is capable of creating two-dimensional layouts using intersecting columns and rows.

## Grid templates: areas & columns

Using `grid-template-areas` and `grid-template-columns` we can define 

```css
grid-template-areas:
  "a a"
  "b c";
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
```

![A grid with an item on the top spanning two columns and two items on the bottom](./grid-columns.svg)

---

## Grid templates: rows

```css
grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
```

![A grid with a single column and three items; the item in the middle is double the height as the other two items above and below it](./grid-rows.svg)

Adding `display: grid` to a container will cause any immediate descendants to become grid items. Similar to flexbox, we can use placement methods to help align, justify, and space grid items inside the container.

---

## Using `place-items`

```css
place-items: center center;
```

![A grid of items centered horizontally and vertically](./center-center.svg)

```css
place-items: end end;
```

![A grid of items aligned to the bottom left corner](./end-end.svg)

```css
place-items: start start;
```

![A grid of items aligned to the top right corner](./start-start.svg)

> ðŸ¤“ Place-items is super effective if using gridbox

**Here is a list of CSS properties used to control gridbox properties:**

> [`grid-area ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-area): Controls a grid item's location

> [`grid-template-areas ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas): Controls cells and assigns names

> [`grid-auto-columns ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-columns): Controls the track size of grid columns

> [`grid-auto-flow ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow): Controls the auto-placement algorithm

> [`grid-auto-rows ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-rows): Controls the track size of grid rows

> [`grid-gap ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap): Controls gaps between columns and rows

> [`grid-template-columns ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns): Controls line names and track size of grid columns

> [`grid-template-rows ðŸ¡•`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows): Controls line names and track size of grid rows

## Positioning

The CSS property `position` determines an elements flow inside a document.

The CSS properties `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are used on positioned elements to control an offset.


They can also be used to determine an object's size when it is unset. 


`z-index` controls the elements order (bringing it to the front or back).

![A series of boxes absolutely positioned in one-another with the dimensions of "left", "right", "top", and "bottom" precalculated](./positioning.svg)

```css
.root {
	position: relative;
	width: 768px;
    height: 272px;
}

.container {
	position: absolute;
	left: 224px;
    top: 100px;
    width: 320px;
    height: 145px;
    z-index: 90;
}

.item {
	position: absolute;
    bottom: 50px;
    right: 90px;
	width: 213px;
	height: 65px;
    z-index: 100;
}
```

There are five types of element positions:

| Positioning type |  Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Static** | <li>**The default position.**</li><li>Unaffected by offset and order.</li> |
| **Absolute** | <li>The element is removed from document flow and positioned relative to the nearest `position: relative` parent.</li><li>Can be offset **relative to the parent container** and ordered.</li> |
| **Fixed** | <li>The element is removed from document flow and positioned relative to the **initial** container.</li><li>Can be offset relative to the initial container and ordered.</li> |
| **Relative** | <li>The element flows normally and provides relative positioning for children elements.</li><li>Can be offset relative **to itself** and ordered.</li> |
| **Sticky** | <li>The element flows normally and "sticks" to the nearest container.</li><li>A mixture between `relative` and `fixed` positions depending on the scroll mechanism.</li><li>Can be offset relative to the **parent** container and ordered.</li> |

# Where do I use Flexbox, Gridbox or Positioning?

### Flexbox

: Csed in headers, lists, tags, or any other block or inline content with the correct flex-direction
: Crimary method to align and justify content in small components
: Casy to use

For example, YouTube uses a flexbox to space out their headers children elements:

![A heading on the YouTube search bar with spacing for each item](./youtube.png)

> ðŸ¤“ Mastering the flexbox will take you very far in CSS as it is used everywhere

### Gridbox 

: Csed in creating complex layouts that require both columns and rows
: Crovides the easiest and shortest way to center elements
: Cerbose and powerful

For example, Spotify uses a gridbox to achieve their playlist player layout:

![A player view of Spotify with a left-hand sidebar and a list of items on the right](./spotify.png)

### Positioning 

: Csed in lightboxes, mobile menus, modal windows, and similar overlaying elements
: Crimarily used to remove elements from document flow

For example, the cookies modal on stackoverflow uses a fixed position to stay on your screen while hovering above other document elements:

![An "accept all cookies" banner on StackOverflow absolutely positioned to the bottom of the page](./stackoverflow.png)
