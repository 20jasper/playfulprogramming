# Angular Templating - From Start to Source

## Article Overview

One of the core concepts to the Angular framework is the idea of templates. Templates allow developers to create embedded views of UI from other locations.

These templates not only power many of Angular's baseline features, but are extremely versatile in their capabilities and serve as a powerful tool to leverage.

- Templates are able to be passed and called manually similarly to functions.
- You can leverage  a set of APIs built into these templates to pass and manipulate data from one template to another during the render process

While this article is far from a comprehensive list of all template related APIs, I do want to walk through as much as I can to help you understand how templates work in Angular, what you're able to do with them, and loosely how they're used within Angular itself. Just some of the APIs we'll be going through include:

- `ng-template`
- `TemplateRef`
- `EmbeddedViewRef`
- `ViewContent`/`ViewChildren`
- `ViewContainerRef`
- `createEmbeddedView`
- [Structural Directives](<https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#asterisk>) (such as `*ngIf`)

While a lot of these examples are going to be small/silly/contrived, they loosely come from patterns I've seen in very large Angular libraries. One of the coolest aspects of templates is the ability to make APIs of consumable codebases which read more naturally and are more feature-filled when leveraged properly. 

This article was written with the idea that the reader is at least somewhat familiar with the introductory concepts of Angular. If you haven't yet done so, the fantastic [Angular getting started guide](https://angular.io/start) is a great place to start.

By the end of this article, you'll not only have read some of Angular's source code (as of [commit 641a4ea](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/641a4ea763e9eb2d41e5225a1c554802668a470b)), but should have a better understanding of how to implement many of these tools and how some of the APIs you use daily work under-the-hood.

It's going to be a long article, so please feel free to take breaks, grab a drink to enjoy while reading, pause to tinker with code, or anything in-between. Feedback is always welcomed and appreciated.

## A Brief Introduction to Templates

### Introductory Example
Before we dive into the meat of this article, let's do a quick recap of what a templates are and what they look like.

While Angular templates come in many shapes and sizes, a simple but common use for them might look something like this:

```html
<ng-template #falseTemp>
  <p>False</p>
</ng-template>
<p *ngIf="bool; else falseTemp">True</p>
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-1-ng-template?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
In this example, we are creating a template and assigning it to a [template reference variable](<https://blog.angulartraining.com/tutorial-the-magic-of-template-reference-variables-3183f0a0d9d1>). _This template reference variable will make `falseTemp` a valid variable to use as a value for other inputs in the same template._ It will then handle that variable similarly to how a variable from the component logic is handled when referenced from the template. 

We are then adding the [`ngIf`](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf) structural directive to the paragraph tag to conditionally render content to the screen.

- If `bool` is true, it will render `<p>True</p>` and the template containing the false will not
- If `bool` is false, it will then check if the [`else` condition built into `ngIf`](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf#showing-an-alternative-template-using-else) has a value assigned to it. If there is a value assigned to the `else` condition, it will render that template. 
  - In this example, it does: The template we've assigned to `templHere`. Because of this, `<p>False</p>` will render

If you had forgotten to include the `ngIf`, it would never render the `False` element because **a template is not rendered to the view unless explicitly told to - this includes templates created with `ng-template`**

### Example Alternative - Let's Checkout `ngTemplateOutlet`

But there's a ~~simpler~~ ~~much more complex~~ another way show the same template code above!

```html
<ng-template #falseTemp>
  <p>False</p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template #ifTrueCondTempl>
  <p>True</p>
</ng-template>
<ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="bool ? ifTrueCondTempl : falseTemp"></ng-template>
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-2-conditional-render?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
> While this is not how the `ngIf` structural template works internally, this is a good introduction to the `ngTemplateOutlet` directive, which adds functionality to the `ng-template` tag.
>
> If you're curious to how Angular's `ngIf` works, read on dear reader.

While I'd mentioned previously that `ng-template` does not render to the DOM, because we're using `ngTemplateOutlet`, it will render the template defined in the passed `ng-template`.

This template that's defined by `ng-template` is called a "view", and when it is rendered to the screen it is called an "embedded view".

This embedded view will be located in the DOM where the `ng-template` that used the `ngTemplateOutlet` directive. Knowing that, you can see that the following example would show the user three of the most mythical beasts imaginable:

```html
<ng-template #unicorns><button>ü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñ</button></ng-template>
<ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="unicorns"></ng-template>
```

With this, combined with template reference variables (ADDLINK: [which we covered at the beginning of this section](#introductory-example)), you may find it easier to use a ternary operator to pass the correct template based on the value of `bool` to create an embedded view of that template.

## Pass Data To Templates - The Template Context

You know how I mentioned that you can pass data between templates (at the start of the article)? This can be accomplished by defining the _context_ of the template. This context is defined by a JavaScript object you pass to the template with your desired key/value pairs (just like any other object). We'll look at an example below, but *think of this in terms of passing data from a parent component to a child component through property binding*. When you define the context of a template, you're simply giving it the data it needs to fulfill its purpose in much the same way.


So, now that we know what they are in broad terms, what do they look like?

### Passing Context To Rendering

While we used the `ngTemplateOutlet` directive before to render a template, we can also pass an input to the directive `ngTemplateOutletContext` in order to pass a context. A context is just an object with a standard key/value pairing.

```html
<ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="templateName"
             [ngTemplateOutletContext]="{$implicit: 'Hello World', personName: 'Corbin'}">
</ng-template>
```

From there, you can use `let` declarations to create template variables in that template based on the values passed by the context like so:
```html
<ng-template #templateName let-message let-thisPersonsName="personName">
  <p>{{message}} {{thisPersonsName}}</p>
</ng-template>
```

Here, you can see that `let-templateVariableName="contextKeyName"` is the syntax to bind any named context key's value to the template input variable with the name you provided after `let`. There is an edge-case you've probably noticed though, the `$implicit` key of the context is treated as a default of sorts, allowing a user to simply leave `let-templateVariableName` to be the value of the `$implicit` key of the context value. 

Now let's see it in action!

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-3-context?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
#### Clarification on Gotchas

##### Template Input Variable Names
As a quick note, _I only named these template input variables differently from the context value key in order to make it clear that you may do so_. `let-personName="personName"` is not only valid, but can be clearer to other developers of it's intentions in the code.

# What A Wonderful `View`: `ViewChild`/`ContentChild`

## Keeping Logic In Your Controller - `ViewChild`

While template reference variables are very useful for referencing values within the template itself, there may be times you'll want to access a reference to an item in the template from the component logic. Luckily, there's a way to get a reference to any component, directive, or view within a component template. 

Using [`ViewChild`](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewChild), you're able to grab a reference to the `ng-template` from the component logic rather than the template code:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `
  	<div>
    	<ng-template #helloMsg>Hello</ng-template>
    </div>
    <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="helloMessageTemplate"></ng-template>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
	// Ignore the `static` prop for now, we'll cover that in just a bit
  @ViewChild('helloMsg', {static: false}) helloMessageTemplate: TemplateRef<any>;
}
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-4-viewchild?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
>  While this example is effectively not-much-more than an alternative API to `ngTemplateOutlet`, it serves as a basis for introducing into further concepts

_ViewChild` is a "property decorator" utility for Angular which will search the component view tree to find whatever you're looking for._ In the example above, when we pass a string of `'templName'`, we are looking for something in the tree that is marked with the template variable `helloMsg`. In this case, it's an `ng-template`, which is then stored to the `helloMessageTemplate` property when this is found. Because it is a reference to a template, we are typing it as `TemplateRef<any>` to have TypeScript understand the typings whenever it sees this variable. 

## Viewing Isn't just For Sight-seeing

`ViewChild` isn't just for templates, either. You can get references to anything in the view tree:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `
  	<my-custom-component #myComponent [inputHere]="50" data-unrelatedAttr="Hi there!"></my-custom-component>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild('myComponent', {static: false}) myComponent: MyComponentComponent;
}
```

For example, would give you a reference to the `MyComponentComponent` instance of the template. If you ran:

```typescript
/* This would be added to the `AfterViewInit` lifecycle method */
console.log(this.myComponent.inputHere); // This will print `50`
```

It would give you the property value on the instance of that component. Angular by default does a pretty good job at figuring out what it is that you wanted to get a reference of and returning the "correct" object for that thing.

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-5-view-not-template?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
Despite the examples thus far having only used a string as the query for `ViewChild`, you're also able to use the ComponentClass to query for a component with that component type.
```typescript
/* This would replace the previous @ViewChild */
@ViewChild(MyComponentComponent) myComponent: MyComponentComponent;
```

Would yield the same results in this particular example. _When using `ViewChild`, it might be dangerous to do this if you have many components with that class._ This is because when using `ViewChild`, _it only returns the first result that Angular can find_ - this could return results that are unexpected if you're not aware of that.

### My Name is ~~Inigo Montoya~~ the `read` Prop
Awesome! But I wanted to get the value of the `data-unrelatedAttr` attribute dataset, and my component definition doesn't have an input for that. How do I get the dataset value?

Ahh, so you've seen the problem with Angular's guessing of what datatype you're looking for. There are times where we, the developer, knows better of what we're looking for than the framework services.

Fancy that.

When we want to overwrite the type of data we expect `ViewChild` to return, we can use a second property passed to the `ViewChild` decorator with the type we want returned. With the use-case mentioned above, we can tell Angular that we want a reference to the element of the component itself by using the `ElementRef`


```typescript
/* This would replace the previous @ViewChild */
@ViewChild('myComponent', {read: ElementRef, static: false}) myComponent: ElementRef; 
```

Now that we've configured the `ViewChild` to read this as an `ElementRef` (A class provided from `@angular/core` to help us with just the thing we're looking for) rather than a component reference, we're able to use the `nativeElement` property of that class to get the HTMLElemenet object for that component instance.

```typescript
/* This would be added to the `AfterViewInit` lifecycle method */
console.log(myComponent.nativeElement.dataset.getAttribute('data-unrelatedAttr')); // This output `"Hi there!"`
```

 `ViewChild` isn't an only child though (get it?). There are other APIs similar to it that will allow you to get references to other items in your templates from your component logic. 

## It's like talking to me: You're flooded with references! - `ViewChildren`

`ViewChildren` will allow you to get a reference to any items in the view that match your `ViewChildren` query as an array of each item that matches:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `
    <div>
        <my-custom-component [inputHere]="50"></my-custom-component>
        <my-custom-component [inputHere]="80"></my-custom-component>
    </div>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChildren(MyComponentComponent) myComponents: QueryList<MyComponentComponent>;
}
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-7-viewchildren?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
Would give you a list of all components with that base class. You're also able to use the `{read: ElementRef}` property from the `ViewChild` property decorator to get a `QueryList<ElementRef>` (to be able to get the reference to the DOM [Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) themselves) instead of a query list of `MyComponentComponent` types.

### What is `QueryList`

While `QueryList` (from `@angular/core`) returns an array-like, and the core team has done a very good job at adding in all the usual methods (`reduce`/`map`/etc) and it _extends an iterator interface_ (so it will work with `*ngFor`  in Angular templates and `for (let i of _)` in TypeScript/JavaScript logic), _it is not an array_. [A similar situation occurs when using `document.querySelectorAll` in plain JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList). _If you're expecting an array from an API that returns `QueryList`, it might be best to use `Array.from`_ on the value (in this case the `myComponents` component prop) when you access it in logic later.

A `QueryList` also allows for some nice additions like the `changes` observable property that will allow you to listen for changes to this query. For example, if you had some components that were hidden behind a toggle:

```html
<!--This would makeup the template of a new component-->
<input type="checkbox" [(ngModel)]="bool"/>
<div *ngIf="bool">
  <my-custom-component></my-custom-component>    
</div>
<my-custom-component></my-custom-component>
```

And wanted to get the value of all component's `numberProp` values reduced into one, you could do so using the `changes` observable:

```typescript
/* This would be added to the `AfterViewInit` lifecycle method */
this.myComponents.changes.subscribe(compsQueryList => {
  const componentsNum = compsQueryList.reduce((prev, comp) => {
    return prev + comp.numberProp;
  }, 0);
  console.log(componentsNum); // This would output the combined number from all of the component's `numberProp` field. This would run any time Angular saw a difference in the values
});
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-8-querylist?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
It might be a good idea to gain familiarity of doing this, as the Angular docs leave the warning when reading through [`QueryList` docs](https://angular.io/api/core/QueryList#changes):

> NOTE: In the future this class will implement an Observable interface.

##Keep an Eye on Your Kids - `ContentChild`

Author's note:

> This section of the article assumes that you know what the `ng-content` tag is. While I could do an in-depth dive on what `ng-content` and content projection is, it's somewhat outside of the scope of this current article is. Let me know if this is something that interests you, I might do another deep deep dive into how Angular parses tags like `ng-content` and how it's handled by Angular's AST and template parsing/etc.
>
> If you're less familiar with `ng-content`, you can probably get by with just knowing how parent/child relationships elements work and just reading through carefully. Never be afraid to ask questions! 
>
> There's also the `:host`selector used in these demos. Think of each component creating their own wrapper `div` - the `:host` selector will apply styling to the component wrapper element itself

I always love nesting some of my code into `ng-content`s. I don't know what's so appealing to having my code look like it's straight out of HTML spec, but just being able to pass component instances and elements as children to one of my components and then tinkering with them is so satisfying.

One thing I always run into though, is that I always end up wanting to style the components that are passed in. Take the following example:

```html
<cards-list> <!-- Cards list has default styling with grey background -->
	<action-card></action-card> <!-- Action card has default styling with grey background -->
	<action-card></action-card> <!-- It's also widely used across the app, so that can't change -->
</cards-list>	
```

Anyone with a sense of design might be cringing about now. Grey on grey? On cards? Yuck! Let's make those cards have some white backgrounds.

This might seem like a trivial task to anyone assuming that these components are built-in HTML elements, of course a CSS stylesheet like so would apply:

```css
// cards-list.component.css
action-card {
  background: white;
}
```

But this is often not the case. _[Angular's  `ViewEncapsulation`](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewEncapsulation) prevents styles from one component from affecting the styling of another_. This is especially true if you're using a configuration that allows the native browser to handle the components under the browser's shadow DOM APIs, which restricts stylesheet sharing on a browser-level. This is why the [Angular-specific CSS selector  `::ng-deep`](https://angular.io/guide/component-styles#deprecated-deep--and-ng-deep) has been marked for depreciation (sorry old-school Angular developers [including myself, so much to migrate üò≠]). s

No matter though, we have the power of `ViewChildren` on our side! Corbin already showed us how to get a reference to an element of a rendered component! Let's spin up an example:

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'action-card',
    template: `<div></div>`,
    styles: [    `
      :host {
        border: 1px solid black;
        display: inline-block;
        height: 300px;
        width: 100px;
        background: grey;
        margin: 10px;
      }
    `]
})
export class ActionCard {}

@Component({
  selector: 'cards-list',
  template: `<div><ng-content></ng-content></div>`,
  styles: [`:host {background: grey; display: block;}`
})
export class CardsList implements AfterViewInit {
  @ViewChildren(ActionCard, {read: ElementRef}) actionCards;

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    // Any production code should absolutely be cleaning this up properly, this is just for demonstration purposes
    this.actionCards.forEach(elRef => {
      console.log("Changing background of a card");
      this.renderer.setStyle(elRef.nativeElement, "background", "white");
    });
  }
}
```

Awesome, let's spin that up and‚Ä¶ Oh.

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-9-cardlist-broke?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
The cards are still grey. Let's open up our terminal and see if the `console.log`s ran. 

They didn't.

Alright, I could keep going but I know you've all read the section title (üëÄ at the skim-readers).

`ViewChildren` is a fantastic tool but only works for the items defined in the template of the component itself. Any children that are passed to the component are not handled the same way and require `ContentChildren` instead. The same applies for `ViewChild` (which has the adjacent API of `ContentChild`). The `ContentChild/ren` should share the same API with their `ViewChild/ren` counterparts.

If we change the `ViewChildren` line to read:

```typescript
@ContentChildren(ActionCard, {read: ElementRef}) actionCards;
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-10-cardlist-fixed?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
We'll see that the code now runs as expected. Cards are recolored, consoles are ran, developers happy.

### The Content Without the `ng`

`ContentChild` even works when you're not using `ng-content` but still passing components and elements as children to the component. So, for example, if you wanted to pass a template as a child but wanted to render it in a very specific way, you could do so:

```html
<!-- root-template.component.html -->
<render-template-with-name>
  <ng-template let-userName>
    <p>Hello there, {{userName}}</p>
  </ng-template>
</render-template-with-name>
```

```typescript
// render-template-with-name.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'render-template-with-name',
  template: `
  <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="contentChildTemplate"
               [ngTemplateOutletContext]="{$implicit: 'Name here'}">
  </ng-template>
`
})
export class AppComponent {
  @ContentChild(TemplateRef, {static: false}) contentChildTemplate;
}
```

This is a perfect example of where you might want `@ContentChild` - not only are you unable to use `ng-content` to render this template without a template reference being passed to an outlet, but you're able to create a context that can pass information to the template being passed as a child.


# Template Variable Access

There are two types of template variables: _template input variables_ and _template reference variables_.

## Template Input Variables

Template input variables are the variables you bind to a template when using context. `<ng-template let-var>`. _These variables are defined from the context that is applied to the template_. As a result *these templates are able to be accessed by the children of the templates, but not from a higher level* - as the context is not defined above the template:

```html
<!-- ‚úÖ This is perfectly fine -->
<ng-template #templateOne let-varName><p>{{varName}}</p></ng-template>

<!-- ‚ùå This will throw errors, as the template context is not available from anywhere that isn't a child of the template -->
<ng-template #templateTwo let-thisVar></ng-template>
<p>{{thisVar}}</p>
```

## Template Reference Variables

Template reference variables, however, have a much more complex answer in regards to how they're able to be accessed.

As a small review of what they are:
_A template reference variable is a variable assigned to a tag so that other items in the same template are able to reference that tag._

```html
<div>
	Hello There!
	<ng-template #testingMessage><p>Testing 123</p></ng-template>
</div>
<ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="testingMessage"></ng-template>

<!-- Will now show the following in the DOM: -->
<!--        <div>Hello There!</div>          -->
<!--           <p>Hi There</p>               -->
```

In this example, we're getting a reference to `testingMessage` template to be able to provide as an input. We're then passing that value to another `ng-template`'s `ngTemplateOutlet` directive to get it rendering on screen. Because the variable is defined in the same *view hierarchy tree* level, it is accessible from an element on a higher DOM tree node. This view hierarchy tree position defines all of the limitations on accessing a template reference variable.

### What Kind of Tree??

Okay, so let's take that last sentence and expand on it a bit. First, a bit of background!

So, when you build out an HTML file, you're defining the shape the document object model (DOM) takes. When you load a file similar to this:

```html
<!--index.html-->
<!-- ids are only added for descriptive purposes -->
<main id="A">
	<ul id="B">
		<li id="C">Item 1</li>
		<li id="D">Item 2</li>
	</ul>
	<p id="E">Text here</p>
</main>
```

_The browser takes the items that've been defined in HTML and turns them into a tree that the browser can understand how to layout and draw on the screen_. That tree, internally, might look something like this:

```
   +--->B---+->C
A--+        |
   |        +->D
   +--->E
```
> Each element in this chart align the ID to the element in the chart

The same could be said for Angular templates! _While Angular renders to the DOM the same as HTML, Angular also has it's own internally tree to keep track of templates defined in Angular_. 

The reason Angular has it's own tree is due to the dynamic nature of Angular. In order to understand how to hide content on the fly, change out the content on screen, and know how to keep consistent expected interactions between all of this, Angular needs to have a tree to keep track of it's state.

Because this tree is not the DOM itself, it shouldn't be confused with the DOM itself. _The tree Angular uses to track it's state is called the "view hierarchy tree"_. This tree is composed of various "views". _A view is a grouping of elements and is the smallest grouping of elements that can be created or destroyed together_.

A simple example of a view is a simple `ng-template`:

```html
<ng-template>I am a view</ng-template>
<ng-template>
  <p>So am I!</p>
  <div>Even with me in here? <span>Yup!</span></div>
</ng-template>
```

When this is rendered on screen (say, by using an `ngTemplateOutlet`), it becomes an "embedded view". This is because you're placing a view into another view. I'll explain:

```html
<ng-template>
  <p>I am in a view right now</p>
  <ng-template #rememberMsg>
    But as you might recall, this is also a view
  </ng-template>
  <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="rememberMsg" [ngTemplateOutletContext]="{$implicit: 'So when we render it, it\'s a view within a view'}"
</ng-template>
```

It's this composition of views that makeup the "view higharchy". A view can act as a "view container" for other views (as it is here), can be moved around, etc. 

As a result of this "view container" being another view itself, it can also be added as a view to another view container, so on so forth.

### A Word on Components

If you're looking for them, you might notice a few similarities between component templates and `ng-template`s. Both of them allow for values to be passed into them (`@Input` props for components, context for templates), both of them are defined with the same template syntaxes (with the same HTML-like syntax).

Well, there's a good reason for that: _A component is actually just a directive with a special view - a "host view" (defined by the `template` or `templateUrl` field in the decorator) associated with it_. This host view can also be attached to another view by using the `selector` value of that component's.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "child-component",
  template: `
		I am the host view, and act as a view container for other views to attach to
		<div><p>I am still in the child-component's host view</p></div>
		<ng-template #firstChildCompTempl>
			I am in a view outside of the child-component's host view
		</ng-template>
	  <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="firstChildCompTempl"
                 [ngTemplateOutletContext]="{$implicit: 'And now I'm attaching that template to the host view by embedding the view'}">
		</ng-template>
	`
})
export class ChildComponent {}


@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `
		I am in app's host view, and can act as a view container for even other host views by using the component's selector
		<child-component></child-component>
	`
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

## Template Variable View 

So, as mentioned before, templates (and by proxy: views) can be stacked into one-another like so:

```html
<ng-template #helloThereMsg>
	Hello There!
	<ng-template #testingMessage><p>Testing 123</p></ng-template>
</ng-template>
```

Obviously, this by itself would not render anything, but let's change that. Let's say I want to use a template outlet for both of these templates outside of the `helloThereMsg` template declaration.

You might think, based on what we know about template reference variables, that rendering the `testingMessage` template as well would be a trivial task - they're accessable accross the template, no? Well, let's try:

```html
<ng-template #helloThereMsg>
	Hello There!
	<ng-template #testingMessage><p>Testing 123</p></ng-template>
</ng-template>
<div>
  <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="helloThereMsg"></ng-template>
</div>
<ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="testingMessage"></ng-template>
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-11-broke-template-var?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
But you'll notice that `testingMessage` isn't rendering, why is that?

Template reference variables bind to the view that they're present in. Like with CSS applied to a DOM element, they apply to the element itself and children, but not the parent.


```
           +-->helloThereMsg view--+-->testingMessage
host view--+
           +--->div
```

Because the `helloThereMsg` template creates it's own view and the `testingMessage` template variable is defined, it is only able to accessable from within the `helloThereMsg` template. Because we're trying to reference it from the host view, it can't find the variable, is marked as `undefined` as a value, and does not render anything (as that's the default behavior of passing `undefined` to `ngTemplateOutlet`)

In order to fix this behavior, we'd need to move the second `ng-template` into the `helloThereMsg` template view

```html
<ng-template #helloThereMsg>
	Hello There!
	<ng-template #testingMessage><p>Testing 123</p></ng-template>
	<ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="testingMessage"></ng-template>
</ng-template>
<div>
  <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="helloThereMsg"></ng-template>
</div>
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-12-fixed-template-var?embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
## Timings - The Bane of any JavaScript developer, now with `ViewChild`

But the example immediately above doesn't have the same behavior as the one before that. We wanted to get:

```html
<div>Hello there!</div>
<p>Testing 123</p>
```

And instead got:

```html
<div>Hello there! <p>Testing 123</p></div>
```

Luckily, we've already covered `@ViewChild`, which is able to get references from further down the view tree than the template is able to.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  template: `
    <ng-template #helloThereMsg>
      Hello There!
      <ng-template #testingMessage>Testing 123</ng-template>
    </ng-template>
    <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="helloThereMsg"></ng-template>
    <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="testingMessageCompVar"></ng-template>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild("testingMessage", { static: false }) testingMessageCompVar;
}
```

Something you'll see if you open the console in that example is the classic error:

```
Error: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'ngTemplateOutlet: undefined'. Current value: 'ngTemplateOutlet: [object Object]'.
```

This error is being thrown by Angular's developer mode (so if you're running a production build, this error will not show). But why is this error happening? What can we do to fix it?

This, my friends, is where the conversation regarding change detection, lifecycle methods, and the `static` prop come into play.

## Change Detection, How Does It Work

While diving into change detection in depth is a massive article all on it's own. While I'm not wanting to deviate too badly from the general discussion around templates, having a bit of understanding on change detection will help in general. That said, here's a general overview of what change detection is and how it applies to that example:

_Angular has specific hooks of times when to update the UI_. Without these hooks, Angular has no way of knowing when data that's shown on screen is updated. These hooks essentially simply check when data has changed. While these checks are imperfect, they has default behavior that will handle most cases and and the ability to overwrite it and even manually trigger a check.

One of the default checks that is ran when Angular is starting the intial render of a component. During this time, it will do a check of all of the values stored within the component's state. Afterwards, it will run checks whenever any data has changed whether or not to update the UI.

These checks trigger the lifecycle method `DoCheck`, which you can manually handle. The `DoCheck` lifecycle method will trigger every time Angular detects data changes, regardless of if the check of that data does not decide to update the item on screen or not.


So let's look at the example we had previously, but let's add some lifecycle methods to evaluate when `ViewChild` is able to give us our value.

```typescript
export class AppComponent implements DoCheck, OnChanges, AfterViewInit {
  realMsgVar: TemplateRef<any>;
  @ViewChild("testingMessage", { static: false }) testingMessageCompVar;

  ngOnInit() {
    console.log("ngOnInit: The template is present?", !!this.testingMessageCompVar)
  }
  
  ngDoCheck() {
    console.log("ngDoCheck: The template is present?", !!this.testingMessageCompVar);
    this.realMsgVar = this.testingMessageCompVar;
  }
  
  ngAfterViewInit() {
    console.log('ngAfterViewInit: The template is present?', !!this.testingMessageCompVar);
  }
}
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-13-lifecycle-explain?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
Looking at the console logs, you'll be left with the following messages in your console:

```diff
- ngOnInit: The template is present? false
- ngDoCheck: The template is present? false
+ ngAfterViewInit: The template is present? true
+ ngDoCheck: The template is present? true
```

You can see that the `testingMessageCompVar` property is not defined until the `ngAfterViewInit`. _The reason we're hitting the error previously is that the template is not defined in the component logic until `ngAfterViewInit`._ *The template is not defined in the component logic because the template is being declared in an embedded view.* As a result, the `helloThereMsg` template must render first, then the `ViewChild` can get a reference to the child after the initial update.

When using only the `ViewChild`, it simply updates the value of the `testingMessageCompVar` in the `AfterViewInit` lifecycle period. This value update is then in turn reflected in the template itself.

However, because of the timing problems (of it not being defined previously and not showing until `ngAfterViewInit`), Angular has already ran change detection and Angular is unsure what to do with the new value. By hooking directly into the second `ngDoCheck` and updating the value by hand, Angular runs change detection and updates the value without there beiong able problems. 


I realize this is a bit confusing, but I think a further dive into lifecycle methods and change detection might help with that and would be outside of the scope of this particular article. [A resource I found extremely useful to help explain this issue came from the 3rd part "Angular University" where they walk through debugging this exact error](https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-debugging¬†/). 

#### Great Scott - You Control The Timing! The `static` Prop

But there might be times where having the value right off the bat from the `ngOnInit` might be useful. After all, if you're not embedding a view into a view, it would be extremely useful to be able to get the reference before the `ngAfterViewInit` and be able to avoid the fix mentioned above.

>  Before I go much further, I will remind viewers that [the `static` prop was introduced in Angular 8](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/28810) - if you're running a version prior to that, this section will not apply to the syntax of how you'd use `ViewChild`/`ContentChild`

Well, that can be controlled via the `static` prop!

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  template: `
		<div>
			<p>Hello?</p>
	    <ng-template #helloThereMsg>
    	  Hello There!
  	  </ng-template>
		</div>
    <ng-template [ngTemplateOutlet]="realMsgVar"></ng-template>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild("helloThereMsg", { static: true }) realMsgVar;
}
```

<iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/start-to-source-14-static?ctl=1&embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
Because this example does not have the `helloThereMsg` template within another view (outside of the host view), it is able to render without the errors we found when using `static: true`). Likewise, if you were to add an `OnInit` lifecycle method, you'd be able to get a reference to that template.

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
	console.log(!!this.realMsgVar); // This would output true
}
```

While you might wonder "Why would you use `static: false` if you can get the access within the `ngOnInit`", the answer is fairly similarly: _when using `static: true`, the `ViewChild` prop never updates after the initial `DoCheck` lifecycle check_. This means that your value will never update from `undefined` when trying to get the reference to a template from within a child view.



When taking the example with the `testingMessageCompVar` prop and changing the value to `true`, it will never render the other component since it will always stay `undefined`.

# Embedded Views - Is That Some Kind of Picture Frame?

### If It Is, This Is The Green Screen - Some Background on Them

Having covered views in the last section, it's important to mention an important limitation regarding them:

>Properties of elements in a view can change dynamically, in response to user actions; the structure (number and order) of elements in a view can't. You can change the structure of elements by inserting, moving, or removing nested views within their view containers.
>
>\- Angular Docs

While we've covered how to insert a component using `ngTemplate`,  Angular also allows you to find, reference, modify, and create them yourself in your component/directive logic! ü§Ø

Let's show an example of how we can render an `ng-template` using TypeScipt component logic:

```typescript
import { Component, ViewContainerRef, OnInit, AfterViewInit, ContentChild, ViewChild, TemplateRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <ng-template #templ>
      <ul>
        <li>List Item 1</li>
        <li>List Item 2</li>
      </ul>
    </ng-template>
    <div #viewContainerRef class="testing">
    </div>
  `
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild('viewContainerRef', {read: ViewContainerRef}) viewContainerRef;
  @ViewChild('templ', {read: TemplateRef}) templ;

  ngOnInit() {
    this.viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ);
  }
}
```

This example has a lot going on, so let's dissect it bit-by-bit.

Starting with some small recap:

- We're creating a template with the `ng-template` tag and assigning it to a template reference variable `templ`
- We're also creating a `div` tag, assigning it to the template reference variable `viewContainerRef`
- Lastly, `ViewChild` is giving us a reference to the template on the `templ` component class property.

Now the new stuff:

- We're also using `ViewChild` to assign the template reference variable `viewContainerRef` to a component class property.
  - We're using the `read` prop to give it the [`ViewContainerRef`](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewContainerRef) class, which includes some methods to help us create embedded view
- Then, in the `ngOnInit` lifecycle ([since neither of our `ViewChild` references are in embedded views themselves](#lakjsdf)), we're running the `createEmbeddedView` method present on the `ViewContainerRef` property to create an embedded view based on the template.

If you take a look at your element debugger, you'll notice that the template is injected as a sibling to the `.testing` div:

```html
<!---->
<div class="testing"></div>
<ul>
  <li>List Item 1</li>
  <li>List Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

[While this has confused many developers, who have expected the embedded view to be children of the `ViewContainer` reference element](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/9035), this is intentional behavior (as-per their comments in the thread), and is consistent with other APIs similar to it.

The reasoning behind this has a lot to do with how **embedded views are tracked**, they're referenced **by Angular in it's source code by it's index**!

For example, if you wanted to see the index, we could use an API on the view container to get the index of the embedded view. To do this, we'd first need a reference of the embedded view in our template logic.

Just like how we have `ViewContainerRef`, there's also [`EmbeddedViewRef`](https://angular.io/api/core/EmbeddedViewRef#embeddedviewref). Luckily, with our previous example, getting that ref is trivial, as it's returned by the `createEmbeddedView` method:

```typescript
const embeddRef: EmbeddedViewRef<any> = this.viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ);
```

From there, we can use the `indexOf` method on the parent `ViewContainerRef`:

```typescript
const embeddIndex = this.viewContainerRef.indexOf(embeddRef);
console.log(embeddIndex); // This would print `0`
```

The view container keeps track of all of the embedded views in it's control, and when you `createEmbeddedView`, it searches for the index to insert the view into. 


You're also able to lookup an embedded view based on the index you're looking for using `get`. So, if you wanted to get all of the indexes being tracked by `viewContainerRef`, you'd do:

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  for (let i = 0; i < this.viewContainerRef.length; i++) {
    console.log(this.viewContainerRef.get(i));
  }
}
```

#### Context

Just as we can use `contextRouterOutlet`, you're able to pass context to a template when rendering it using `createEmbeddedView`. So, let's say that you wanted to have a counting component and want to pass a specific index to start counting from, you could pass a context, ADDLINK: [with the same object structure we did before](#pass-data-to-template‚Äîthe-template-context), have:

```typescript
import { Component, ViewContainerRef, OnInit, AfterViewInit, ContentChild, ViewChild, TemplateRef , EmbeddedViewRef} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
   <ng-template #templ let-i>
        <li>List Item {{i}}</li>
        <li>List Item {{i + 1}}</li>
    </ng-template>
    <ul>
	    <div #viewContainerRef></div>
    </ul>
  `
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild('viewContainerRef', {read: ViewContainerRef}) viewContainerRef;
  @ViewChild('templ', {read: TemplateRef}) templ;

  ngOnInit() {
    const embeddRef3: EmbeddedViewRef<any> = this.viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ, {$implicit: 3});
    const embeddRef1: EmbeddedViewRef<any> = this.viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ, {$implicit: 1});
  }
}
```

In this example, because we want to have an unordered list with list elements being created using embedded views, we're getting a `ViewContainerRef` directly from inside the unordered list.
But you'll notice a problem with doing this if you open up your inspector (or even just by reading the code):
There's now a `div` at the start of your list.

To get around this, we can use the `ng-container` tag, which allows us to get a view reference without injecting a DOM element into the fray. _`ng-container` can also be used to group elements without using a DOM element_, similar to how [React Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) work in that ecosystem.

```html
<ng-container #viewContainerRef></ng-container>
```

#### Move/Insert Template

But oh no! You'll see that the ordering is off. The simplest (and probably most obvious) solution would be to flip the order of the calls. After all, if they're based on index - moving the two calls to be in the opposite order would just fix the problem. 

But this is a blog post, and I needed a contrived example to showcase how we can move views programmatically:


```typescript
const newViewIndex = 0;
this.viewContainerRef.move(embeddRef3, newViewIndex);
```

Angular provides many APIs to take an existing view and move it and modify it without having to create a new one and run change detection/etc again.

If you're wanting to try out a different API and feel that `createEmbeddedView` is a little too high-level for you (we need to go deeper), you can create a view from a template and then embed it yourself manually.

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  const viewRef1 = this.templ.createEmbeddedView({ $implicit: 1 });
  this.viewContainerRef.insert(viewRef1);
  const viewRef3 = this.templ.createEmbeddedView({ $implicit: 3 });
  this.viewContainerRef.insert(viewRef3);
}
```

[And in fact, this is how the `createEmbeddedView` works internally](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/f1fb62d1e556de16c8a15054428add27fbc48fc0/packages/core/src/view/refs.ts#L174):

```typescript
// Source code directly from Angular
createEmbeddedView<C>(templateRef: TemplateRef<C>, context?: C, index?: number):
EmbeddedViewRef<C> {
  const viewRef = templateRef.createEmbeddedView(context || <any>{});
  this.insert(viewRef, index);
  return viewRef;
}
```



## Accessing Templates from a Directive

So now that we have some understanding of how to create views programmatically, let's see how we can use directives to create them without any concept of a template being associated directly with that logic.

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[directiveName]'
})
export class DirectiveHere implements OnInit {
  @ContentChild(TemplateRef, {static: true}) templ;
  constructor (private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef) {
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ);
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <div directiveName>
      <ng-template>
          <p>Hello</p>
      </ng-template>
    </div>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

Because Angular treats directives extremely similarly to components, you'll notice this code is almost exactly the same from some of our previous component code.

However, the lack of a template associated with the directive enables some fun stuff, for example, _we can use the same dependency injection trick we've been using to get the view container reference_ to get a reference to the template element that the directive is attached to and render it in the `ngOnInit` method like so:


```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[directiveName]'
})
export class DirectiveHere implements OnInit {
  constructor (private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef, private templ: TemplateRef<any>) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ);
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <ng-template directiveName>
        <p>Hello</p>
    </ng-template>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

With directives, we can even create an input with the same name, and just pass that input value directly to the template using a context:

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[directiveName]'
})
export class DirectiveHere implements OnInit {
  constructor (private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef, private templ: TemplateRef<any>) {}

  @Input() directiveName: string;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ, {$implicit: this.directiveName});
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <ng-template [directiveName]="'Hi there!'" let-message>
        <p>{{message}}</p>
    </ng-template>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

With this syntax, we can add a second input, pass an object as the context to one of the inputs, and then a template reference variable, and be able to recreate Angular's `templateOutlet`

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[directiveName]'
})
export class DirectiveHere implements OnInit {
  constructor (private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef) {
  }

  @Input() directiveName: TemplateRef<any>;
  @Input() directiveNameContext: Object;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.directiveName,  this.directiveNameContext);
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <ng-template [directiveName]="template1"
                 [directiveNameContext]="{$implicit: 'Whoa ü§Ø'}"></ng-template>
    <ng-template #template1 let-message>
        <p>Testing from <code>template1</code>: <b>{{message}}</b></p>
    </ng-template>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

While a very rudimentary example, it's not entirely dis-similar to how Angular writes the component internally:

```typescript
// This is Angular source code with some lines removed (but none modified otherwise).
// The lines removed were some performance optimizations by comparing the previous view to the new one
@Directive({selector: '[ngTemplateOutlet]'})
export class NgTemplateOutlet implements OnChanges {
  private _viewRef: EmbeddedViewRef<any>|null = null;

  @Input() public ngTemplateOutletContext: Object|null = null;
  @Input() public ngTemplateOutlet: TemplateRef<any>|null = null;

  constructor(private _viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) {}

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
      if (this._viewRef) {
        this._viewContainerRef.remove(this._viewContainerRef.indexOf(this._viewRef));
      }

      if (this.ngTemplateOutlet) {
        this._viewRef = this._viewContainerRef.createEmbeddedView(
          this.ngTemplateOutlet, this.ngTemplateOutletContext);
      }
   }
}
```

### A Note on Components

Now that you've dived a bit deeper into templates, it might be a fun time to point out that components are just a type of Directives. [To quote the Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components#directives):

> A component is technically a directive. However, components are so distinctive and central to Angular applications that Angular defines the `@Component()` decorator, which extends the `@Directive()`decorator with template-oriented features.

# Structural Directives - What Sorcery is this?

If you've used Angular in any scale of application, you've ran into Angular helpers that look a lot like directives and start with a `*` such as `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`. These helpers are known as **structural directives**  and are built upon all of the things we've learned to this point. 

The main idea behind structural directives is that **they're directives that will wrap the tag that you've applied it to inside of a template without the need for an `ng-template` tag**.

Let's look at a basic sample to start:


```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[renderThis]'
})
export class DirectiveHere implements OnInit {
  constructor (private templ: TemplateRef<any>,
               private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef) {
  }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ);
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
      <p *renderThis>
          Rendering from <code>structural directive</code>
      </p>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
```



ADDLINK: [Just as we previously used Angular's dependency injection (DI) system to get a reference to the `ViewContainerRef`](), we're using DI to get a reference to the `TemplateRef`  created by the `*` in the invocation of this directive and embedding a view.

Too much CS speak? Me too, let's rephrase that. When you add the `*` to the start of the directive that's being attached to the element, you're essentially telling Angular to wrap that element in an `ng-template` and pass the directive to the newly created template. 

From there, the directive can get a reference to that template from the constructor (as Angular is nice enough to pass the template to our directive when we ask for it [this is what the DI system does]).

The cool part about structural directives, though? Because they're simply directives, **you can remove the `*` and use it with an `ng-template` directly **. Want to use the `renderThis` without a structural directive? No problem! Replace the template with the following code block and you've got yourself a rendered template:

```html
<ng-template renderThis>
  <p>
    Rendering from <code>ng-template</code>
  </p>
</ng-template> 
```
It is for this reason that **only one structural directive can be applied to one element**. Otherwise, how would it know what order to wrap those directives in? What template should get what reference to what template?

### Building A Basic `*ngIf`

But rendering a template without changing it in any way isn't a very useful structural directive. Remove that directive and your code has exactly the same behavior. However, Angular provides something not-altogether-different from what we started on as a useful utility to hide/show a view based on a boolean's truthiness: `ngIf`. 

So if we added an input with the same name as the directive (ADDLINK: [as we did previously]()) to accept a value to check the truthiness of, added an `if` statement to render only if the value is true, we have ourselves the start of an `ngIf` replacement that we've built ourselves!


```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[renderThisIf]'
})
export class DirectiveHere implements OnInit {
  constructor (private templ: TemplateRef<any>,
               private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef) {
  }

  @Input() renderThisIf: any; // `any` since we want to check truthiness, not just boolean `true` or `false`

  ngOnInit(): void {
    if (this.renderThisIf) {
      this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ);
    }
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <div *renderThisIf="bool">
      <p>Test</p>
    </div>
    <label for="boolToggle">Toggle me!</label>
    <input id="boolToggle" type="checkbox" [(ngModel)]="bool"/>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  bool = false;
}
```

Super cool! But you noticed while running your test (which you should totally have üëÄ) that toggling the checkbox doesn't actually show anything! This is because it's running the check once on `ngOnInit` and not again when the input changes. So let's change that:

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[directiveName]'
})
export class DirectiveHere {
  constructor (private templ: TemplateRef<any>,
               private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef) {
  }

  private _val: TemplateRef<any>;

  @Input() set directiveName(val: TemplateRef<any>) {
    this._val = val;
    this.update();
  }

  update(): void {
    if (this._val) {
      this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ);
    }
  }
}
```

You'll notice that I removed the `OnInit` lifecycle and replaced it with an input `set`ter. We could have changed the lifecycle method to use `ngOnChanges` to listen for input changes, given that we only have one input, but as your directive adds more inputs and you want to maintain the local state, that logic can get more complex.

Running our tests again, we see that toggling it once now shows the embedded view, but toggling it again after that does not hide it again. With a simple update to the `update` method, we can fix that:

```typescript
update(): void {
  if (this._val) {
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ);
  } else {
    this.parentViewRef.clear();
  }
}
```

Here, we're using the `clear` method on the parent view ref to remove the previous view when the value is false. Because our structural directive will contain a template only used for this directive, we can safely assume that `clear` will only remove templates created within this directive and not from an external source.

#### How Angular Built It

While Angular goes for a more verbose pattern due to additional features available in their structural directive, the implementation is not too different from our own. 

The following is the Angular source code for that directive. To make it easier to explain with our current set of knowledge, there have been lines of code removed and a single conditional modified in a very minor way. Outside of these changes, this is largely unchanged.

````typescript
@Directive({selector: '[ngIf]'})
export class NgIf {
  private _context: NgIfContext = new NgIfContext();
  private _thenTemplateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;
  private _thenViewRef: EmbeddedViewRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;

  constructor(private _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>) {
    this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;
  }

  @Input()
  set ngIf(condition: any) {
    this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;
    this._updateView();
  }

  private _updateView() {
    if (this._context.$implicit) {
      if (!this._thenViewRef) {
        this._viewContainer.clear();
        if (this._thenTemplateRef) {
          this._thenViewRef =
            this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._thenTemplateRef, this._context);
        }
      } else {
        this._viewContainer.clear();
      }
    }
  }
}

export class NgIfContext {
  public $implicit: any = null;
  public ngIf: any = null;
}
````

Just to recap, let's run through this line-by-line:

1. `_context` is creating a default of `{$implicit: null, ngIf: null}` 
  - The object shape is defined by the `NgIfContext` class below
  - This is to be able to pass as a context to the template. While this is not required to understand how Angular implemented this directive in basic terms, it was left in to avoid editing code elsewhere
2. We're then defining a variable to keep track of the template reference and the view reference ([what `createEmbeddedView` returns](https://angular.io/api/core/EmbeddedViewRef)) for usage later
3. The constructor is then assigning the template reference to the variable, and getting a reference to the view container
4. We're then defining an input with the same name as a setter, as we did with our implementation
   - This setter is also calling an update function, just as were with our implementation
5. The update view is then seeing if the `$implicit` value in the context is truthy (as we're assigning the value of the `ngIf` input to the `$implicit` key on the context)
6. Further checks are made to see if there is a view reference already.
   - If there is not, it will proceed to make one (checking first that there is a template to create off of)
   - If there is, it will not recreate a view, in order to avoid performance issues by recreating views over-and-over again

## Microsyntax

Alright, we've made it thus far! The following section is going to be kinda a doozy so if you're feeling tired, a nap is certainly in order. Otherwise, let's get up - do a little shoulder shimmy to get ourselves moving for a bit (I'm totally not just writing this for my future self who's gonna be re-reading this, noooope), and dive in.

### `let`s iveday inway

>  That's "let's dive in" in Pig Latin

Just as Angular parses the rest of the template you pass in to be able to convert your custom Angular components into template tags, *Angular also provides a small language-like syntax into its own query system*. This syntax is referred to as a "microsyntax" by the Angular devs. _This syntax is able to let the user create specific APIs that tie into this syntax and call/leverage specific parts of their code_. Sound vague? I think so too, let's look at a fairly minimal example:

````typescript
function translatePigLatin(strr) {
	// See the code here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/freecodecamp-algorithm-challenge-guide-pig-latin/16039/7
}

@Directive({
  selector: '[makePiglatin]'
})
export class DirectiveHere {
  constructor(private templ: TemplateRef<any>,
    private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef) {}

  @Input() set makePiglatin(val: string) {
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ, {
      $implicit: translatePigLatin(val)
    });
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <p *makePiglatin="'This is a string'; let msg">
      {{msg}}
    </p>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {}
````

This might look familiar. We're using the `$implicit` value from the context within our structural directive! However, ADDLINK: [if you review the section we introduced that concept in](), you'll notice that the syntax here is different but similar from a template variable that would be used to bind the context from an `ng-template` tag. 

The semicolon is the primary differentiator between the two syntaxes in this particular example. The semicolon marks the end to the previous statement and the start of a new one (the first statement being a binding of the `makePiglatin` property in the directive, the second being a binding of the `$implicit` context value to the local template variable `msg`). This small demo already showcases part of why the microsyntax is so nice - it allows you to have a micro-language to define your APIs.

Let's continue exploring how leveraging this tool can be advantageous. What if we wanted to export more than a single value in the context? How would we bind those named values?

```typescript
export class DirectiveHere {
  constructor(private templ: TemplateRef<any>,
    private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef) {}

  @Input() set makePiglatin(val: string) {
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ, {
      $implicit: translatePigLatin(val),
      original: val
    });
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <p *makePiglatin="'This is a string'; let msg; let ogMsg = original">
      {{msg}} is {{ogMsg}} in üê∑ Latin
    </p>
  `
})
```

Just as before, we would use semicolons to split the definitions, then bind the external (as in: from the directive) context value of `original` to the local (this template) variable of `ogMsg`.



### Additional Attribute Inputs

With a typical directive, you'd have inputs that you could add to your directive. For example, you could have a directive with the following inputs:

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[consoleThing]'
})
export class ConsoleThingDirective {
  @Input() set consoleThing(val: string) {
		if (this.warn) {
			console.warn(val)
			return
		}
	 	console.log(val)
  }
  
  @Input() warn: boolean = false;
}
```


And then call them with the following template:

```html
<ng-template [consoleThing]="'This is a warning from the üëª of code future, refactor this please'" [warn]="true"></ng-template>
```

This can be super useful for both providing concise APIs as well as provide further functionalities to said directive simply. Structural directives offer similar, although it comes with it's own syntax and limitations due to the microsyntax API.

```typescript
export class DirectiveHere implements OnInit {
  constructor(private templ: TemplateRef<any>,
    private parentViewRef: ViewContainerRef) { }

  @Input() makePiglatin: string;
  @Input() makePiglatinCasing: 'UPPER' | 'lower';

  ngOnInit() {
    let pigLatinVal = translatePigLatin(this.makePiglatin)
    if (this.makePiglatinCasing === 'UPPER') {
      pigLatinVal = pigLatinVal.toUpperCase();
    } else if (this.makePiglatinCasing === 'lower') {
      pigLatinVal = pigLatinVal.toLowerCase();
    }
    this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ, {
      $implicit: pigLatinVal,
      original: this.makePiglatin
    });
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <p *makePiglatin="'This is a string'; casing: 'UPPER'; let msg; let ogMsg = original">
      {{msg}} is {{ogMsg}} in üê∑ Latin
    </p>
  `
})
export class AppComponent { }
```

You can see that I've had to tweak our previous pig latin directive example a bit.

For starters, I moved away from a `set`ter for the input value and towards `ngOnInit`, just to ensure that everything was defined in the right timing.

I'm also binding the value "upper" to `makePiglatinCasing` by adding `casing: 'UPPER'` to the input to the structural directive and then separating it by `;`.

The magic in the syntax comes from that input name. I know in previous examples I've mentioned when things were similarly named only for readability purposes and not because the syntax demands such - this is not one of those times. *The microsyntax is taking the  `casing` binding from the input, making the first letter uppercase, then prepending it to the template selector to get the name of the `@Input` directive property to pass that value to.* 

This means that you can change the name of that input to just about anything and the syntax will handle passing it. Want to make it `makePiglatinCasingThingHere`? No problem, just change that part of the input syntax to read `casingThingHere: 'upper'`

#### You Say `potatoe;` I Say `potatoe:`

It's worth mentioning that the syntax for this is fairly loose. You're able to move things around a bit. If it's the second argument, you can drop the `;`

```html
<p *makePiglatin="'This is a string' casing: 'UPPER'; let msg; let ogMsg = original">
```

You can drop the `:` regardless of if you use the `;`

```html
<p *makePiglatin="'This is a string' casing 'UPPER'; let msg; let ogMsg = original">
```

```html
<p *makePiglatin="'This is a string'; casing 'UPPER'; let msg; let ogMsg = original">
```

While this might seem very strange (especially because most fully-scoped languages have very rigid syntax), there's a lot of advantages and syntactical niceness as a result of this flexibility.

##### Always Be Willing To Take Input

While the syntax is flexible, it's not unbreakable. *If you're expecting to pass an input to the directive, you must have the first thing in the syntax be the input value*. For example:

```html
<p *makePiglatin="casing 'UPPER'; 'This is a string'; let msg; let ogMsg = original">
```

Would throw an error at you as it's not valid syntax. Even if you weren't passing a value to the `makePigLatin` prop and only wanted to pass a value to the `makePigLatinCasing` prop:

```html
<p *makePiglatin="casing 'UPPER'; let msg; let ogMsg = original">
```

This wouldn't be valid syntax and would still throw an error. However, if you wanted to start a microsyntax with a local template variable definition, this IS valid:

```html
<p *makePiglatin="let msg casing 'UPPER'; let ogMsg = original">
```

This follows the same rules as before where the `;` between the `let` and `casing` and the `:` between `casing` and `'upper'` are both still validly optional.


#### Why not bind like a typical input?

Now, I remember when I learning a lot of the structural directive stuff, I thought "well this syntax is cool, but it might be a bit ambiguous". I decided I was going to change that a bit:

```html
<p *makePiglatin="'This is a string'; let msg; let ogMsg = original" [makePiglatinCasing]="'UPPER'">
  {{msg}} is {{ogMsg}} in üê∑ Latin
</p>
```

I was not, however, greeted by praises on my PR making this change, but rather by an error in my console:

> Can't bind to `makePiglatinCasing` since it isn't a known property of `p`

This may seem strange upon first glance but remember: *The structural directive wraps the tag it is on inside of a template*. Because of this, _the `makePiglatinCasing` input is not set to the directive anymore, but rather on the `p` element inside the template created by the structural directive_


#### Bind as you would - They're JUST directives!

Okay now you just hold your horses there, you author person you. The very last thing I read was explaining the differences between structural directives and directive bindings! What gives?

This is true, but that only applies for binding to a structural directive the way you would a non-structural directive because of the limitations in the microsyntax. However, because they're just directives underneath, you can use the same directive code you'd expect to.

```html
<ng-template [makePiglatin]="'This is a string'" [makePiglatinCasing]="'UPPER'" let-msg let-ogMsg="original">
  <p>{{msg}} is {{ogMsg}} in üê∑ Latin</p>
</ng-template>
```



### `as` to preserve values in template variable

Like some of my favorite tools to use, the microsyntax has a very powerful tool that allows you to do many things. This is the `as` keyword.

On paper, it sounds extremely straightforward and almost useless: It saves the context output of a specific value as a template variable. The simplest example of such is using the keyword `as` as a replacement to some of the syntax shown before:

```html
<p *makePiglatin="let msg casing 'UPPER'; original as ogMsg">
```

Because `original` is being exported by the `makePiglatin` context, you can save the value to a template variable `ogMsg`.

But this example doesn't showcase very much of what makes the `as` keyword as powerful as it is: It can handle more complex expressions, such as piped values:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <p *ngIf="message | uppercase as uppermessage">{{uppermessage}}</p>
		<!-- Will output "HELLO THERE, WORLD" -->
  `
})
export class AppComponent {
  message = "Hello there, world"
}
```

While this example can be seen clearly with this usage of `ngIf` , let's try to add it into our `pigLatin` example:

```html
<p *makePiglatin="let msg; casing 'upper' | uppercase as upperInUpper">{{upperInUpper}}: {{msg}}</p>
```

In this example, we're expecting `'upper'` to be turned into `'UPPER'` by the `uppercase` pipe, then to be passed as the input to `makePiglatinCasing` and for the `$implicit` value of that context to be assigned to a local variable  `msg`. If you load this, you'll noticed that the uppercased pig lattin displays as expected but the `upperInUpper` variable (which we expected to be `'UPPER'`) is undefined.

The reason is because we're not exporting a key of `makePiglatinCasing` in our context to supply this value. 

```typescript
this.parentViewRef.createEmbeddedView(this.templ, {
	$implicit: pigLatinVal,
	original: this.makePiglatin,
	makePiglatinCasing: this.makePiglatinCasing
});
```

Now that we're exporting the output with the `as`, it should show on screen as expected. So why is this? *Well, `as` exports the outputted value that it's bound to.*  In this case, we're binding the value to `casing` (because that's what `'upper'` is being passed as an input to).

Of course, this means that you can send any value as the context. Change the code to read:

```typescript
{
	$implicit: pigLatinVal,
	original: this.makePiglatin,
	makePiglatinCasing: 'See? Any value'
}
```

And the DOM would now show: 


> See? Any value: ISTHAY ISWAY AWAY ESTTAY




#### But it worked in `ngIf`

And this is true, but only because the Angular devs were kind enough to make this syntax approachable without having to understand the inner-workings of it before using it.

If we ADDLINK: [go back to the original section where we showed `ngIf` code from the Angular syntax](), you can see they're using the same trick to provide the `as` value for a call to `ngIf`:

```typescript
this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;
```



### Let's remake `ngFor`

[The Angular section on structural directives say that you should probably study the `ngFor` code to understand them better](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#microsyntax). Let's do them one better - let's make our own. 

Well okay, let's at least make a version of it that supports a limited part of it's API (just for conciseness). 

sSo what is the API we want to support?

`*uniFor="let item of items; let firstItem = isFirst"`

Sounds reasonable enough. Just to make things even easier on us, let's not worry about re-rendering the list if it updates or properly cleaning up if this directive view unrenders. These requirement changes make our code much more simple for demonstration purposes, but inherently makes the resulting code unfit for production. 

```typescript
@Directive({ selector: '[uniFor]' })
export class UniForOf<T> implements AfterViewInit {
  @Input() uniForOf: Array<T>;

  constructor(
    private viewContainer: ViewContainerRef,
    private template: TemplateRef<any>
  ) {}

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    this.uniForOf.forEach((ofItem, i) => {
      this.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.template, {
        isFirst: i === 0,
        $implicit: ofItem,
        uniForOf: this.uniForOf
      })
    })
  }
}

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
	<p *uniFor="let num of numbers | async as allNumbers; let firstItem = isFirst>
		Number in a list of {{allNumbers.length}} numbers: {{num}}
		<ng-container *ngIf="firstItem"> it's the first number!</ng-container>
	</p>
	`
})
export class AppComponent {
  // `import {of} from 'rxjs';`
  numbers = of([1,2,3,4,5])
}
```

- We're starting with enabling `uniFor` as the structural directive name
- Then we're defining an input to accept `of` as a key in the syntax (to match the `ngFor` structural directive syntax). 

- We can then reference this value later with `this.uniForOf` just as we are in the `ngAfterViewInit`.

- In that lifecycle method, we're then creating an embedded view for each item in the array
  - This view is passed a context with an implicit value (so that `_var` in`let _var of list` will have the  value of this item)
  - We also pass the index to the context to give a boolean if an item is the first in a list
  - Then we pass a `uniForOf` so that we can use `as` to capture the value passed to the `of` portion of the syntax
- Finally, we use the [async pipe](https://angular.io/api/common/AsyncPipe) to get the value of the array that's inside of an observable



# Conclusion



All in all, Angular has extremely powerful tools that it provides to you out-of-the-box for managing templates across your application. These APIs allow for tons of potential within a library or app and knowing how to use them is only just the start to the fun. 

Other than that, that's it! You reached the end, you did it! üéä
