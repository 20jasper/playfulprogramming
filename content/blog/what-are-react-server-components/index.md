[In our last article in the series, we talked about how React is able to pre-generate HTML from JSX on the server (or developer's machine) prior to being shipped to the end-user](/posts/what-is-ssr-and-ssg). This process is called "SSR" and can be mission-critical in getting your applications as performant as possible.

I originally wrote that article in early 2020. At this point in React's development lifecycle, there was an inherent problem to using SSR; it would lead to duplicate effort between the server and the client.

See, up to that point Next.js and other React SSR solutions had one way of doings things:

1) Render [the VDOM](/posts/what-is-reconciliation-and-the-vdom) on the server
2) Generate HTML from the server's VDOM
3) Ship HTML and all of the React code to the client
4) Re-generate the VDOM from scratch on the client
5) Wipe away the old DOM and re-render all components from the new client's VDOM instance

This process is called "Rehydration" and while it _worked_ the way it did before, it introduced a new performance problem. Rehydration could be needlessly expensive if most of your content coming from the server was going to be static anyway. This was a huge problem that the React team had to solve.

Later, in the same year of my article (December 2020), they had the answer: [React Server Components](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html).

# What is a React Server Component (RSC)?

In short; React Server components allow you to designate which React components render on the server and which components re-initialize on the client. This is done using a special syntax in your components and allows for special server-only data loading patterns when implemented properly.

For example, take the following:

```jsx
function App() {
	return <>
		{/* Render parts on the client */}
		<Header/>
		{/* Render all of it on the client */}
		<Dashboard/>
		{/* Render all of it on the server */}
		<Footer/>
	</>
}
```

When executed, it might look something like the following process:

![// TODO: Write alt](./react-server-components.svg)

Here, we can see that `<ProfilePicture>`, `<Dashboard/>`, and all of their children will be re-initialized on the client. Meanwhile the `<Footer>` and `<Header>` components will not re-initialize on the client.

> Keep in mind, client-components will still pre-generate HTML on the server by default. The difference here is that the client re-initialization is now informed by the VDOM constructed on the server, allowing for drastically reduced required execution.

# What is `use server` and `use client`?

In React Server Components, the syntax to dictate which components are rehydrated or not will vary from metaframework-to-metaframework. A `"use server"` and `"use client"` string at the top of each file is how Next.js makes this distinction.

Let's use Next.js' syntax to build out the example from above, distinguishing which type of component is which along the way:

```jsx
"use server"
// page.jsx
import {ProfilePicture, Dashboard} from "./client-components"

export function App() {
	return <>
		<Header/>
		<Dashboard/>
		<Footer/>
	</>
}

function Footer() {
	// ...
}

function Header() {
	return (
		<>
			<SearchBar/>
			<ProfilePicture/>
		</>
	)
}


function SearchBar() {
	// ...
}
```

```jsx
"use client"
// client-components.jsx
export function Dashboard() {
	return (
		<Chart/>
	)
}


function Chart() {
	// ...
}

export function profilePicture() {
	// ...
}
```

# Other



So! Instead, what React did is introduce "Server Components", where you can do a few things:

- Not re-render on the client
- Fetch data on the server and return it to the client ðŸ¤« (spoilers for what I'm _gonna_ write)

So instead of:

```tsx
<Layout>
  <Header/>
  <Content/>
  <Footer/>
</Layout>
```

And having React render 4 components on the server, then re-render 4 components on the client - you might have:

```tsx
<ServerLayout>
  <ServerHeader/>
  <ClientContent/>
  <ServerFooter/>
</ServerLayout>
```

And keep the first 4 component renders on the server, but _only_ re-render `ClientContent` on the client, saving the amount of JS needed and the speed in parsing

So that's the RSC (React Server Component) story
