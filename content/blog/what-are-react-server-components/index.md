So! Instead, what React did is introduce "Server Components", where you can do a few things:

- Not re-render on the client
- Fetch data on the server and return it to the client ðŸ¤« (spoilers for what I'm _gonna_ write)

So instead of:

```tsx
<Layout>
  <Header/>
  <Content/>
  <Footer/>
</Layout>
```

And having React render 4 components on the server, then re-render 4 components on the client - you might have:

```tsx
<ServerLayout>
  <ServerHeader/>
  <ClientContent/>
  <ServerFooter/>
</ServerLayout>
```

And keep the first 4 component renders on the server, but _only_ re-render `ClientContent` on the client, saving the amount of JS needed and the speed in parsing

So that's the RSC (React Server Component) story
