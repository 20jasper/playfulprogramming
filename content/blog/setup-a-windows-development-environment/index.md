Ask any developer running off of a Linux or macOS machine, and they'll be able to tell you what about their systems make them such a strong contender for development usage. Some of the top contenders I've heard are:

- Package management
- Terminal usage
- Window Tiling
- Customization

What many don't know is that Windows has gained many of these options over the years. Between official tooling such as WSL2 right around the corner to third-party offerings becoming more-and-more mature, there's never been a better time to be a developer on the Windows platform.

Moreover, much of what we'll be taking a look at today is either free, open-source, or both! There will be a few mentions of paid software as alternatives to free options, but I've personally used every paid software that I'll be mentioning.

> I understand that for some, Windows simply isn't their cup of tea. Additionally, I acknowledge that other platforms may do things *_better_* than Windows can. However, Windows is undisputedly a cheaper option than MacOS and often required for application usage where WINE and others fall flat. Just keep an open mind and understand that this isn't a put-down of other options.
