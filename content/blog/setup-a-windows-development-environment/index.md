Ask any developer running off of a Linux or macOS machine, and they'll be able to tell you what about their systems make them such a strong contender for development usage. Some of the top contenders I've heard are:

- [Package management](#package-management)
- [Terminal usage](#terminal-usage)
- Window Tiling
- Customization

What many don't know is that Windows has gained many of these options over the years. Between official tooling such as WSL2 right around the corner to third-party offerings becoming more-and-more mature, there's never been a better time to be a developer on the Windows platform.

Moreover, much of what we'll be taking a look at today is either free, open-source, or both! There will be a few mentions of paid software as alternatives to free options, but I've personally used every paid software that I'll be mentioning.

> I understand that for some, Windows simply isn't their cup of tea. Additionally, I acknowledge that other platforms may do things *_better_* than Windows can. However, Windows is undisputedly a cheaper option than MacOS and often required for application usage where WINE and others fall flat. Just keep an open mind and understand that this isn't a put-down of other options.

# Package Management {#package-management}

When it comes to CLI package management on Windows, nothing beats [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). [It only takes a single PowerShell command to install](https://chocolatey.org/install), not unlike [Homebrew for macOS](https://brew.sh/). The comparisons with Homebrew don't stop there, either; Much like it, Chocolatey is an unofficial repository of software but does include checks of verification for a select number of popular packages.

It's also popular amongst sysadmins due to its ease of deployment across multiple devices and stability.

You'll need to run in an administrator window, but once you do, you'll find the utility straightforward. A simple `choco search package-name` will find related packages to the name you input where areas `choco install package-name` will install the package.

## Manage Packages via GUI {#chocolatey-gui}

Readers, I won't lie to you. I'm not the kind of person to use CLIs for everything. I see their worth entirely, but it's simply not my strong suit remembering various commands even if I understand the core concepts entirely. For people like me, you might be glad to hear that _Chocolatey has a GUI for installing, uninstalling, updating, and searching packages_. It's as simple as (Chocolate) pie!

![A list of installed software via the Chocolatey GUI](./choco_gui_list.png)

You can see that it gives a list of installed packages with a simple at-glance view of what packages need updating.

## Suggested Packages {#suggested-packages}

While Chocolatey has a myriad of useful packages to developers, there are some packages that I have installed on my local machine that I'd like to highlight.

For starters, what's a developer machine without `git`? Let's throw that on:

```
choco install git.install
```

Additionally, I know a lot of developers would like to have access to common GNU utilities, such as `rm` and `touch`. Using an install flag, you're able to add those to your path for usage:

```
choco install git.install--params "/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath"
```

## Windows Store {#windows-store}

I'm sure some avid Microsoft fans will have pointed out by now that I forgot something. You know, the official solution by Microsoft? Naturally, I haven't forgotten about the Windows Store.

While some of you may be surprised to hear this, the Microsoft Store has gained a fair number of development tools on its storefront. For example, there's now a package for Python that's now there. You're also able to get quick updates for all of your apps and seamlessly integrate them as-if they were typical windows apps.

# Terminal Usage {#terminal-usage}

Terminal usage is essential for most developers. It's a relatively universal utility regardless of what form of programming you're into. It's important to make sure that your terminal is fully featured for functionality and customizable for tastes and fun.



## Terminal Options {#terminals}

One of the most important elements to one's terminal usage is, well, the terminal itself! While Windows has not historically had many options in this regard, things have turned around in recent years. Additional to the built-in CMD and PowerShell windows, we now have many newcomers, including one from Microsoft itself.

First, let's start with the unofficial offerings. We have many options, but the two I want to highlight is `Cmder` and `Terminus`.

### Cmder {#cmder}

[Cmder is an open-source terminal offering](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) built on top of a long-standing base called [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/). It provides a massive set of configurations that I think make the terminal much more useful and pretty. For example, this is the default view of Cmder:

![A preview of the cmder terminal open on the UU repo](./cmder.png)

As you can see, there's some custom logic for embedding Git metadata in the prompt, a custom `Î»` prompt, and even contains some logic for more effective tab autocomplete. You're even able to install it via Chocolatey using `choco install cmder`! 

The terminal itself contains all kinds of functionality:

- Multi-line copy+paste
- Tiling
- Tabs
- Customizable UI

Those are just the features at the top of my head! What's nice about Cmder is that even if you don't use the terminal itself, you can use the configurations for CMD and PowerShell with other shells if you'd like. All of the screenshots for the other terminals will be shown using the Cmder configs.

### Terminus {#terminus}

Terminus is another excellent option for those looking for alternative terminal shells. Because it's rendered using web tech, it's UI is much more customizable. It also has an easy-to-install plugin system to add further functionality to the shell. What you're seeing is the initial out-of-the-box experience [with the Cmder configuration applied](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Seamless-Terminus-Integration)

![A preview of the Terminus shell with the Cmder config](./terminus.png)

### Windows Terminal {#windows-terminal}

Last, but certainly not least, we have the newly-introduced Windows Terminal. This is the new terminal that's being built by Microsoft themselves. [The project is open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) and the preview is even installable   [via the Windows Store](https://aka.ms/windowsterminal).

![A preview of the Windows Terminal](./windows_terminal.png)

This terminal shell has been the most stable in my usage. It supports tabs, a highly customizable UI, and different tabs with the different shells supported.

#### Cmder Integration {#windows-terminal-cmder}

While Cmder integration with Windows Terminal is relatively trivial, it's not very well documented. Let's walk through how to do so.

You'll want to start by making sure you have an environmental variable called `cmder_root`. This should be set up by default if you installed it using `choco`, but if you're unsure, you can check manually. [We outline how to set environmental variables in this article](#env-variables).

Once we're sure that we have the configuration setup properly, we'll open up the settings file in Windows Terminal by pressing the dropdown button and selecting "Settings."

![A preview of the Settings button](./windows_terminal_setting.png)

Once this is done, update your `cmd` setting to have the following `commandline` config property:

```json
"commandline": "cmd.exe /k %cmder_root%/vendor/init.bat",
```

You can even do so for PowerShell:

```json
"commandline": "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command \"Invoke-Expression 'Import-Module ''%cmder_root%/vendor/profile.ps1'''\"",
```

This is what my `profiles` looks like all together:

```json
"profiles": [
    {
        "guid": "{5b4ef9a8-4506-4ac9-930a-5eb1fd0ebf20}",
        "name": "Cmder",
        "commandline": "cmd.exe /k %cmder_root%/vendor/init.bat",
        "icon": " %cmder_root%/icons/cmder.ico",
        "hidden": false,
        "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%/git"
    },
    {
        "guid": "{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}",
        "name": "Windows PowerShell",
        "commandline": "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command \"Invoke-Expression 'Import-Module ''%cmder_root%/vendor/profile.ps1'''\"",
        "hidden": false,
        "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%/git",
    },
],
```

Finally, if you want to set one of these profiles as default (I wanted to make my new PowerShell config default), you can update the `defaultProfile ` parameter at the top of the file. Mine looked like this:

```json
"defaultProfile": "{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}",
```

#### Color Configuration {#windows-terminal-colors}

Windows terminal also supports customization of the colors for the terminal, among other things. The color settings I used for the screenshot above is the Dracula color theme.  You can add that color theme by adding the following to the `schemes` array in the `profiles.json` file:

```json
"schemes": [
    {
        "name" : "Dracula",
        "background" : "#282A36",
        "black" : "#21222C",
        "blue" : "#BD93F9",
        "brightBlack" : "#6272A4",
        "brightBlue" : "#D6ACFF",
        "brightCyan" : "#A4FFFF",
        "brightGreen" : "#69FF94",
        "brightPurple" : "#FF92DF",
        "brightRed" : "#FF6E6E",
        "brightWhite" : "#FFFFFF",
        "brightYellow" : "#FFFFA5",
        "cyan" : "#8BE9FD",
        "foreground" : "#F8F8F2",
        "green" : "#50FA7B",
        "purple" : "#FF79C6",
        "red" : "#FF5555",
        "white" : "#F8F8F2",
        "yellow" : "#F1FA8C"
    }
],
```

Then, for each of the profiles you want to have that color scheme, add the following property:

```
"colorScheme": "Dracula"
```

Resulting in the following for my PowerShell config:

```json
{
    "guid": "{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}",
    "name": "Windows PowerShell",
    "commandline": "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command \"Invoke-Expression 'Import-Module ''%cmder_root%/vendor/profile.ps1'''\"",
    "hidden": false,
    "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%/git",
    "colorScheme": "Dracula"
}
```
