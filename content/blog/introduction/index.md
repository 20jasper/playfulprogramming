Welcome to the Web Framework Field Guide. This resource is the culmination of 7+ years of professional software development as well as over a year of writing, editing, and polishing.

This resource will teach you how to build applications, the concepts under-the-hood of modern web frameworks, and the advanced coding patterns to help you level up your engineering.

While there exists other resources that can help you learn these concepts for one framework at a time, **this collection will help you learn 3 different frameworks at once; for React, Angular, and Vue alike.**

Namely, we'll be taking a look at the most modern iterations of these frameworks: React 18, Angular 14, and Vue 3.

> It's worth mentioning that React and Angular iterate their major versions much more frequently than Vue. If you're reading this in the future and see "Angular 22", it's likely that it's using similar concepts under-the-hood.

I will take the time to take asides for each framework in order to explain where they differ and how they work under-the-hood individually.

By the end of this series, you should be able to confidently navigate any codebase utilizing these frameworks.

But I'm getting ahead of myself, first, let's answer some fundamental questions.

# Why should I learn web development today?





## Why should I learn these tools?







## What's the size of these tools?

[These frameworks account for 9% of the web in 2021](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/javascript#libraries-usage) and are consistently growing.

For example, React accounts for 12 million downloads a week from NPM alone.







Likewise, while smaller, Angular is alive and well today (unlike its eerily similarly named yet distinct predecessor "AngularJS"). 

Angular gains over 2 million downloads a week from NPM, and powers sites such as Microsoft's [Xbox website](https://www.madewithangular.com/sites/xbox), their [Office Web Home](https://www.madewithangular.com/sites/microsoft-office-home) site, Google's [Voice website](https://www.madewithangular.com/sites/google-voice), their [Messages site](https://www.madewithangular.com/sites/google-messages), [Firebase's dashboard](https://www.madewithangular.com/sites/google-firebase), and many many more.



Finally, Vue has gained rapid growth in the last few years. From [gaining 50 million downloads in 2019 to over 125 million in 2022 on NPM](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=vue&from=2019-01-01&to=2021-12-31) , it's seen staggering success in the ecosystem.



### Will these tools stick around?

Honestly? Who's to say. While the ecosystem has its fluctuations and there are many developers who definately seem to feel some level of burnout from, say, the React ecosystem after so long within it.

But here's the thing: these tools are widely backed and utilized by some of the biggest companies there are.

These types of tools don't disappear overnight, nor do the jobs associated with these tools.

Take ColdFusion for example. If you ask most front-end developers, they may likely either not know of ColdFusion, or assume it dead. After all, ColdFusion goes back to 1995 and remains a proprietary paid programming language — yes, those exist — to this day.

But ColdFusion isn't dead! (I can hear my friend Mark holler with excitement from miles away) It's still used by as many websites as Angular is, and maintains an ecosystem of a respectible size that's big enough to allow Adobe to maintain development of the language, 27 years later.

What's more, from the cultural standpoint, many developers are also tired of switching back and forth between new frameworks at seemingly breakneck speeds. Many companies may choose to stay with these tools for longer than anticipated simply because they've grown in expertice with these tools.

Just because a tool is new, doesn't mean that it's inherently better; and even tools that are percieved better may not be selected for various reasons.




## Who's building what?









# What will we be learning?






- Ecosystem numbers
  
- Mention tooling and third party packages
- Outline contents
- React has two methods of display: We'll focus on hooks
- Vue has two methods of display: We'll focus on options API
