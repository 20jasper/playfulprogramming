Oftentimes, in computer programming, you'll find yourself needing a way to give a unique identifier to a digital asset. Whether those are books in your "To Read" digital bookshelf, computers on your network, or anything in between; you need a quick and easy way to access that data with an ID that's distinct.

If you've done much research on this problem, you'll likely have heard of a "universally unique identifier" (UUID) or "globally unique identifier" (GUID) as their usage is wide reaching in the software industry.

While it's good to recognize popular technologies, a few questions remain:

- What is a UUID?
- What are the various versions of UUID?
- Why are they so widely utilized?
