Computers - on a very low level - are built upon binary (ones and zeros). Think about that - all of the text you're reading on your screen started life as either a one or a zero in some form. How can it turn something so simple into a sprawling sheet of characters that you can read on your device? 

## Binary to Integers

When you or I count, we typically use 10 numbers in some variation of combination to do so: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

When you count to 10, you're really using a combination of 1 and 0 in order to construct a larger number that we cognizantly recognize. The number 10 persists in our minds even when we have it written out; ten.

Knowing that we can separate the number from our thoughts allows us to categorize the number in a further manor, breaking it down into smaller groupings mentally. For example, if we take the number 34, for example, we can break it down into three groups: the ones, the tens, and the hundreds.

For the number 34, we break it down into: 0 hundreds, 3 tens, and 4 ones. We then can add them together to make the number we all know and love: 34. We do the breakdown in terms of exponents due to the fact that we can represent every number up until that point. 9 is represented by 9 ones, but without a tens column we can't represent any number higher than that. Similarly, we can't represent any number above 99 without a hundreds column.

Now this may seem rather simplistic, but it's important to demonstrate this to understand binary. This is known as the base 10 system. Called such because there are 10 symbols used to construct all other numbers (once again, that's: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).

Binary, on the other hand, is base two (for the latin enthusiasts, binarius meaning "two together" is where the name comes from. *Deca*, meaning 10, is where "decimal" comes from). This means that there are only two numbers that exist in this numerical system: 0 and 1.

So how does this play out when trying to represent the number 34?

As you can see, we create columns that are exponents of the number 2 for similar reasons as exponents of 10. Without a 4 column, we can't represent any number higher than 3 (with 1 one and 1 two).

Funnily enough, if you've used a HEX value in HTML and CSS, you may already be loosely familiar with a similar scenario. Hexadecimal is the base 16 number set (hexa meaning "six" in latin, deca meaning "ten", combing to mean "sixteen"). Now you may wonder how you can count to 16 when we only use 10 numbers. The answer, to many developers, is to fill the remaining last 6 with other symbols: letter.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

These are the symbols that makeup the hexadecimal numerical systems for many devs. A, in this case, represents the number 10. F being the number 15. In this numerical system, there are the "sixteens", the "two-hundred fifty sixs" (gathered by multiplying 16 by itself), etc
